FIX: PostgreSQL connection issues in Docker environment

- Added PostgreSQL service to docker-compose.yml with proper network configuration
- Created application-prod.properties for production environment with database connection to containerized PostgreSQL
- Configured PostgreSQL container with:
  * Port mapping 5000:5432 for compatibility with existing configuration
  * Database initialization from Database-Setup directory
  * Persistent volume for data storage
  * Proper dependency management (backend depends on database)
- Removed obsolete deploy.sh script
- Fixed network connectivity between backend and database containers

QA Acceptance Criteria:
- Backend connects successfully to PostgreSQL container
- Database initializes with existing SQL scripts
- Docker Compose stack starts all services correctly
- No connection refused errors in application logs

DoD:
- Changes committed to develop branch
- Jenkins pipeline can build and deploy the complete stack
- Database connectivity verified in containerized environment
